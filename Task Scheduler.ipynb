    "The algorithm used in the first part of this assignment can be thought of as a rough draft toward generating a optimal scheduler. The schedulers working could be only possible under some strict restrictions, which do not seem feasible when we look at real-life, like no possibility of multitasking and waiting for tasks when a time constraint task is coming up instead of trying to do the shorter task during that time period. So we realize that by choosing specific values for time constraints for some tasks like choosing 12:00 PM for a game, we can make the schedule suboptimal. This is possible if right now the time is 11:50 AM and the task that has the next priority task has 20 minutes of duration; however, we still have a task in our queue that takes only 10 minutes and would be the perfect fit here but has the lowest priority. The algorithm will not be able to complete this task of 20-minute duration, and instead of going for the shorter task to fill the gap, it would have to wait for 12:00 PM and do that first. The algorithm also failed when we tried to change the task ids of the tasks, which meant that there was some sort of unreasonable dependency of the schedule on the task ID, which does not make sense and will need to be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue we have to face is going over the daily time period, meaning when a person has a lot of stuff in his schedule, the schedule will go over the day period, which will ruin the purpose of the task scheduler. Thus, we need to be careful when we input the tasks that need to be completed to ensure that it is feasible to complete them in one day while also taking note of the fact that the scheduler should just stop assigning activities if we have reached the end of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue I found was that the schedule was created in one go and did not go on a step-wise basis, waiting until after a task was completed. This would mean the first scheduler that we get will be the final one we are using, which in some cases would not go well as some activities can take longer than what we estimated, and some can take a shorter time. Like if I am watching a football match, I would estimate that it will take 105 minutes, considering the match length and the break. Still, there is a possibility the match will go into extra time, and thus the duration of the task will go from 105 minutes to 140 minutes. On the other hand, while we are having breakfast, we might finish it before our estimated time and thus end up having some extra time left. By taking a sequence-wise scheduler that would take our duration after we have completed the task and aided by the factor of priority value, we will be able to complete the highest priority tasks in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I think my initial scheduler did well when analyzing the priority. It could schedule the task with higher priority first, which allowed us to maximize our profit value. Furthermore, even if something urgent came up and we had to leave our schedule midway, we would have already completed the tasks with the highest profit value and thus would not feel too bad.\n",

    "An optimal scheduler will ideally try to answer all the concerns and issues that I have mentioned above. It should be able to take into consideration the profit values that we assign it, look to maximize this profit value instead of trying to fit as many activities as possible in the schedule, be able to be edited midway if need be, and be able to ensure that we are not going over the time of one day. To make the system of profits more realistic, we should also consider adding losses when assigning profits to the priority and try to minimize these losses; if we were to go to Potsdam, the profit value would be high as we can travel, but it will also cost us money which will be considered as a loss. Hence, the loss also has to be factored in when we are finalizing our profits for a task. However, this can be just implemented when we write our priority values, and thus we do not need to define a separate attribute for it."

    "A. The first addition is straightforward. We will need to add another attribute for the tasks; thus, we create called multi_tasking. This will simply hold a Boolean value which suggests whether or not a task is multitaskable or not. Now we need to ensure that the tasks that are taking place together make sense and are practical. One approach can be to define another attribute called multi_task_with, an array that can hold all the other tasks a particular task can be multitasked with. We can also consider how much duration will be of all these tasks taking place together. We can use the duration of the longest task as it will encompass all the shorter tasks with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other way is to make a method focused solely on multitasking. This method will handle all the computations needed for scheduling. We can first implement a check to see which tasks are multi-taskable and which are not. The tasks that are not multi-taskable can be pushed inside a temporary list, and then we can deal with the multi-taskable tasks. We can see the duration of these tasks and appropriately show which task will be finished at what time. For example, tasks 1 and 2 are multi-taskable, 1 takes 20 minutes, and 2 takes 30 minutes first; we show 1 completed after 20 minutes and then show 2 completed 10 minutes later. After dealing with the multi-taskable tasks within the same class, we can push the non-multi-taskable task into the priority queue again and handle them accordingly."

    "B. I originally utilized two priority queues to help me arrange my data in terms of time constraint tasks and priority. This allowed me to handle task priority effectively while also managing the time constraints within my schedule. The time-constrained queue would pop up whenever the time for this task was coming up, and with a simple check, we will see if no other task can be done before the time constraint task. If true, we will proceed with the time constraint task. If we were to use an additional priority queue, it might be helpful when accessing root node values quickly. Thus we will be able to get rid of our multitaskable tasks in the most effective way possible. However, introducing this priority queue specifically for multitaskable tasks might complicate the code. Including a method instead can be an effective approach to carrying out multitaskable tasks. This way, we can check which tasks are multitaskable and do them together. Also, building upon the previously mentioned attribute, multi_task_with, we can use it like the attribute dependencies and ensure that only suitable multitaskable tasks are done together."

So going step by step through each task that is provided, we do these checks, and if the task is feasible, we do it; otherwise, we move on to the next task, which has the highest priority after the one we were looking at. The main focus of this strategy is to analyze the priority value as a whole and compare it to the priority of the other tasks, with the duration attribute being used to check if the task is currently feasible."

    "We use heaps when we sort the tasks based on their priority value and when we are sorting the time-constrained tasks. This is effective as heaps are very efficient when it comes to sorting tasks compared to other sorting methods like when we are sorting lists on their own. Heaps also have the benefit of making retrieval of tasks easier as to get the highest priority task; we can just call the root node. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second data structure used is classes. We have used three classes in our implementation. The first class is Maxheapq which contains all the methods and attributes needed to use heap. The second class is Task which takes the input and compiles it without doing anything to the input. It just has attributes and no functionality otherwise. The third class is TaskScheduler which contains all the main methods required to compute the scheduler. The reason for keeping the Task and TaskScheduler class separate is to make it easy to maintain our code. If we want to edit how the algorithm perceives a certain input, we can just make edits to the Task class. If we want to make any edits to how we are setting the priorities and scheduling the data, we can change the TaskScheduler class. Keeping them separate allows us to make edits in one place without worrying about what happens in other places."

So the scheduler will skip the tasks with lower priority values if we cannot fit the schedule into one day. The user can try to ensure that they are able to properly assign the values for priority based on what activities have to be done today, no matter what.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second assumption we make is that the user knows what profit value they will assign to each task. This is crucial as our algorithm heavily relies on how the priority values have been assigned and if there was a mislabeling of a priority value for a particular task that can mess up the schedule."

    "When comparing to dynamic programming, we can see that the greedy algorithm will take less space in terms of memory as we are not using a table to find the best possible combination. Instead, we are focussing on choices made at each possible decision point. Looking at the algorithm, we can see that there is no use of nested loops, and there are some new assessments of variables and the creation of priority queues. Still, their size is limited to n, so we can say that the additional space required would be 4 * n as each integer will hold a value of 4 bytes. Thus our space complexity will be O(n)."

    "#### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are going for dynamic programming, our primary goal is to make sure that we compute our final output by combining solutions to smaller and smaller subproblems. To incorporate this into a task scheduler, we will have to compute the best possible combination of tasks that will provide us with the highest total profit value. This is done by comparing the profit values for different combinations. We can look at all the possible combinations and give the user the best possible case. In order to incorporate this approach into our algorithm, we can use a table to keep track of the best possible profit values. The algorithm will then go through each possibility and will then try to maximize the profit value by comparing it to the previous one and seeing if it is higher. If it is, then the value is noted down in the table. If, however, the new value is lower, it continues to note down the previous value as the highest. By following this method, when we reach the end of the table, the table[n][m] value is the highest possible value and thus will be our output."

    "#### Data Structures:\n",
    "We used three data structures for the dynamic programming implementation of our task scheduler: heaps, classes, and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we sort tasks based on their priority value, heaps are our main go-to data structure. This is because heaps are easier to use than other sorting methods and are more time-efficient than these other methods. For our task scheduler, we have to get the current highest priority task multiple times, and with the use of heaps, it becomes easier as we just need to extract the root node in order to get the task that has the highest priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second data structure class also has been extensively used as we have used three classes in our algorithm. Maxheapq class contains all the attributes and methods needed for computing heap. Task class, which just takes in an input and compiles it into a list without doing anything to the input as it has no functionality and only possesses attributes. TaskScheduler class contains all the main functionality of the algorithm in the form of methods. The main reason for keeping the second and third classes separate is to make it easy to maintain our code. By separating them, we define two areas, Task class as the area of input. Thus we can make changes in the class Task to make edits to the inputs without touching the computing part, which is the TaskScheduler class which we will edit if we want to the way the scheduler works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and last data structure used are tables, which allow us to get the best possible profit value by looking at all possible combinations of tasks that can be done and then computing the profit we will gain from each combination. All the profit values for different combinations can be compared until we get our highest profit value which will be in the bottom right position of the table."

    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "The first assumption we make is that the person who is inputting the information has a good sense of the profit they expect to get from each task, or they can assign the priority value well. This bit is entirely based on how the user of the scheduler thinks, and it is upon them on how they assign different profit or priority values to different tasks. Before finalizing the value of priority, I assume the person does an in-depth mental computation to decide the optimum priority values for each task by considering all the gains and losses he can get from that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second assumption I have to make is that there are no time constraint tasks. We have to assume this because, in order to calculate all the possible combinations of tasks, we need them to be free of any such time constraints as only then will we be able to make different combinations freely and thus come to our best combination of tasks to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final assumption is that by dynamically checking all possible combinations of tasks, we will be able to get our optimal value for the profit value. However, this will not be able to account for the fact that we are multi-tasking because it will not be able to factor in two or more tasks being performed at the same time. This means that we will face cases where the highest possible profit value output we get from the dynamic check will be different and most probably lower than the actual value we observe from the tasks."

When going with a greedy algorithm, we can see how adaptive it is, as even if we have to leave our schedule midway, we will be able to maximize our profit value until that point due to the greedy property. However, the greedy approach does not guarantee that we will get an optimal scheduler. As it is greedy, it will try to make multitaskable tasks happen together, even if they do not seem to go together, based on their priority value.\n",

Thus, it could be a supporting point in showing that the greedy algorithm will be a better choice computationally as it takes less time to compute compared to dynamic programming. However, we need to keep in mind that a greedy algorithm does not always give us the best output, which can be bad if we want a optimal schedule always. On the other hand, we also need to consider the fact that dynamic programming does not include time constraints. This limits its usage and practicality. \n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the space complexity analysis, the theoretical analysis did not match with the experimental analysis for dynamic programming. One potential reason can be the limited input size, which was insufficient to show us asymptotic behavior. However, increasing the input size presented a problem as it took too long for the code to run, so we left it like that. Due to these factors, we can look at time complexities analysis when it comes to showing support for a particular algorithm over another as it provides us with clear evidence."

    "ComputationalCritique: In my last assignment, I could not properly understand how the algorithm was working, which led to some inaccuracies in my time recurrence calculation. My explanation regarding where the certain complexities came from and how we can better utilize them was also lacking. To improve upon that, I have ensured to include both a theoretical and experimental analysis of the complexities. Furthermore, I compared the complexities of the two algorithms and provided evidence for why a particular algorithm will be better based on the evidence I got from its analysis.\n",

    "DataStructures: In my last assignment, my use of this LO was lacking as I did not delve into the depth of why a particular DataStructure is better than the other. I tried to overcome this by showing how a particular data structure that handles multi-tasking may be useful in some cases and also explained the potential drawbacks that might come with it in depth.\n",

Sometimes my wording would be too vague, which would not be easily understandable to anyone. To improve upon that, I wrote an in-depth explanation of how the two algorithms discussed in this assignment worked to reach their final solution and also wrote detailed pseudocode, which can act as a backbone for that explanation."

    "audience: I professionally designed my assignment by going step by step from one to the next. This can be seen when we separate and complete one algorithmic strategy first, then the other, and finally bring their analysis together for comparison. Also, the formatting of the paper has been done in an effective manner. Overall, the way I tailored the assignment will easily be understandable by anyone who has basic knowledge of CS110.\n",
    "\n",
    "constraints: It was an important part of my assignment as I had to base how my schedule was working based on certain constraints like the fixed time constraint and multi_tasking constraint. Although I could not implement the constraint for the multi_tasking, my usage of time constraint was still effective. By assigning the time constraint to a priority queue, I was able to keep track of the tasks that had a specific time to them. This second priority queue acted as a side list from which we could check in each iteration whether a particular time constraint task was coming up or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "optimization: This HC was an important part of this whole assignment as our main goal was to optimize the task scheduler through two different algorithmic approaches, namely the greedy approach and the dynamic programming approach. We had to find the strategy that provided the optimal schedule and maximized our profit while also not using too much space and time."
